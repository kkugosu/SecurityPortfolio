# Security Portfolio

Welcome to my Security Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects related to various aspects of network security and cloud security. Here's a brief overview of what you can find in this portfolio:

## 1. Basic Network

In this section, I delve into the fundamentals of networking. You'll find projects and documentation that cover key concepts such as network protocols, IP addressing, routing, and more. These basics form the foundation for understanding more complex security topics.

## 2. Socket Programming

Here, I demonstrate my proficiency in socket programming. This involves creating scripts and applications that can handle network communication using sockets. You'll see examples of both TCP and UDP socket usage, illustrating how data is transmitted securely over a network.

## 3. Multi-Thread Synchronization

Concurrency is a critical aspect of modern computing. In this part of the portfolio, I explore multi-threading and synchronization techniques. These skills are essential for creating efficient and secure network applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without compromising data integrity or security.

## 4. RPC and gRPC

Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and Google's gRPC are powerful paradigms for building distributed applications. In this section, I showcase my work with these technologies, focusing on how they can be used to build secure, scalable, and efficient network services.

## 5. AWS Cloud Security

The cloud is an integral part of today's IT infrastructure, and securing cloud resources is paramount. This section highlights my experience with AWS Cloud Security. It includes projects and case studies on securing cloud resources, managing identity and access, and ensuring data protection in the cloud environment.
